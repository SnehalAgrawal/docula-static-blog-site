# AI in Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on AI agents to navigate, avoid obstacles, and make decisions in real time. These AI agents integrate perception, planning, and control to ensure safe and efficient driving.

## Perception

AI agents in vehicles use sensors such as cameras, radar, and lidar to perceive the surroundings. Object detection, lane recognition, and traffic signal identification are handled by deep learning models running within the agent.

## Decision-Making

Once the environment is perceived, the agent evaluates possible actions. Planning algorithms determine the optimal route, and decision modules handle dynamic scenarios like sudden obstacles or changing traffic conditions.

## Learning and Adaptation

Many autonomous vehicle agents use reinforcement learning to improve performance over time. By simulating driving scenarios, the agent can learn to respond safely to rare or complex situations that are difficult to pre-program.

## Applications

- Self-driving taxis and shuttles
- Driver assistance systems in modern cars
- Logistics and delivery vehicles

Autonomous vehicles demonstrate the power of AI agents in real-world applications, combining multiple layers of perception, reasoning, and learning to operate safely without human intervention.
