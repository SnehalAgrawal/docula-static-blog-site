# AI Agents: An Overview

AI agents are autonomous programs capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning, and taking actions to achieve objectives. Unlike traditional software, AI agents are not strictly deterministic; they can adapt to changing conditions and learn from experience.

## Key Components

1. **Sensors:** Collect information from the environment. In robots, this could be cameras or lidar; in software agents, it could be APIs or user inputs.
2. **Actuators:** Allow the agent to interact with the environment. Examples include motors in robots or commands in software systems.
3. **Decision-Making Module:** Uses rules, models, or learning algorithms to decide the next action.

## Types of AI Agents

- **Simple Reflex Agents:** React to current conditions using predefined rules.
- **Model-Based Agents:** Maintain internal representations of the world to make informed decisions.
- **Goal-Based Agents:** Choose actions based on the achievement of specific objectives.
- **Learning Agents:** Continuously improve by learning from past experiences and feedback.

## Benefits

AI agents enhance automation, reduce human workload, and enable decision-making in complex systems. They are widely used in robotics, virtual assistants, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.

AI agents represent the backbone of intelligent systems. Their ability to perceive, reason, and learn makes them essential for building adaptive technologies in dynamic environments.
